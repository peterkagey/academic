  abstract = {We provide computationally efficient methods for unranking derangements and ménage permutations. That is, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to extract the kth such permutation under the lexicographic ordering. More generally, we show that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for unranking words in lexicographic order whenever there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for counting the number of such words with a given prefix. We use rook theory to give a polynomial-time algorithm for counting the number of derangements and ménage permutations with a given prefix and in turn use this to give an unranking algorithm. This has applications to combinatorics, probability, modeling, and data compression.}

  abstract = {We classify an algebraic phenomenon on several families of wreath products that can be seen as coming from a generalization of a puzzle about switches on the corners of a spinning table. Such puzzles have been written about and generalized since they were first popularized by Martin Gardner in 1979. In this paper, we build upon a paper of Bar Yehuda, Etzion, and Moran, a paper of Ehrenborg and Skinner, and a paper of Rabinovich to provide perhaps the fullest generalization yet, modeling both the switches and the spinning table as arbitrary finite groups combined via a wreath product. We classify large families of wreath products depending on whether or not they correspond to a solvable puzzle, completely classifying the puzzle in the case when the switches behave like abelian groups, constructing winning strategies for all wreath products that are p-groups, and providing novel examples for other puzzles where the switches behave like nonabelian groups, including the puzzle consisting of two interchangeable copies of the monster group M. Lastly, we provide a number of open questions and conjectures, and provide other suggestions of how to generalize some of these ideas further.}
